Final project for CSCI 4370


Project Title :

	Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter (LRO) Image Storage

Project Description: 

	The LRO satellite is a NASA spacecraft that has been orbiting the Moon since its launch in 2009. The mission of LRO was to capture images of the surface and reconstruct
	them into 3-D maps at 100-meter resolution. This mission was accomplished, as LRO has constructed these maps for upwards of 98% of the Moonâ€™s surface. An issue arises when
	thinking about the storage of these images and their associated data (time, location, etc). It is important that the data itself and its metadata are properly stored such that
	researchers and users alike can access images, and know which location on the Moon they are associated with. 

Solution:

	Our solution for this problem is to create a database that will store the image data (through references to file urls?) and metadata that is associated with each image. This
	metadata will include information about what time each image was collected, what instrument type was used, the associated location on the lunar surface, and more. Users will be
	able to interact with the database via a web application. 

ER Model : 





ER to Table Conversion :

	Instruments(instrument_id, instrument_type, instrument_desc)
	Images(image_id, image_file_name, image_file_size, instrument_id)
	Target(target_id, target_name, target_lat, target_long, target_alt)
	MetaData(product_id, observation_time, product_creation_time, image_id  target_id)
