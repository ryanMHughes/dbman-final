We used SCrypt for storing passwords.

Passwords are never stored as plaintext.
SCrypt is a memory-hard, computationally intensive key derivation function designed to defend against brute-force and hardware-accelerated attacks. 
This means it was built for security.
SCrypt also automatically generates a unique, random salt for each password, which is embedded inside the resulting hash.
This makes it even harder for attackers.
Although its more memory intensive than BCrypt, it is safer. It is even safer than some SHA.

The general idea for verification is that passwords are encoded, stored encoded, then when a 
user needs to log in, the password they use to log in is then encoded and checked against the
encoded string in the database.
