We securely store user passwords using the SCrypt password hashing algorithm (via Spring Securityâ€™s SCryptPasswordEncoder). SCrypt is a memory-hard, computationally intensive key derivation function designed to defend against brute-force and hardware-accelerated attacks. SCrypt automatically generates a unique, random salt for each password, which is embedded inside the resulting hash. Plaintext passwords are never stored. When a user registers or updates their password, the password is hashed using SCrypt before being saved to the database. During login, the plaintext password provided is hashed using the same SCrypt parameters and compared (using constant-time comparison) against the stored hash.nThe resulting hash string includes the salt, algorithm parameters, and hash, making it self-contained and secure for storage in the database.
