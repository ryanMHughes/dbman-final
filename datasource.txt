Source of Data :

       We used the LRO QuickMap interface, located at https://quickmap.lroc.asu.edu/?prjExtent=-1739780%2C-1737400%2C1739780%2C1737400&shadowsType=all&layers=NrBsFYBoAZIRnpEBmZcAsjYIHYFcAbAyAbwF8BdC0yioA&proj=10

       The site is a public source for Lunar map data, as well as other celestial bodies such as Mars, Mercury, and Venus.

       Data for specific landing sites was obtained from this interface by navigating to the 'LRO Satellite' layer and then importing data pertaining to landing sites. This information includes 'url', 'landing_site_name', and other attributes. Bounding box information is alos listed under each landing site on this interface, and was ported over. The data was webscraped over to /var/lib for use in the database.
