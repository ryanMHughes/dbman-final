Source of Data :

       We used the LRO QuickMap interface, located at https://quickmap.lroc.asu.edu, as well as the PDS archive for LROC data, located at https://pds.lroc.asu.edu/data/LRO-L-LROC-3-CDR-V1.0/

       QuickMap is a source for Lunar map data, as well as other celestial bodies such as Mars, Mercury, and Venus.

       The linked PDS archive is an archive specifically for the first data dump from LROC back around ~2009.

       Data for specific landing sites was obtained from this interface by navigating to the 'LRO Satellite' layer and then importing data pertaining to landing sites. This information includes 'url', 'landing_site_name', and other attributes. Bounding box information is alos listed under each landing site on this interface, and was ported over. The data was webscraped over to /var/lib for use in the database.
